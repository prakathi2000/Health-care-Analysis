Used ML techniques to build a model to accurately predict whether the patients have diabetes or not. 
Diabetes is considered as one of the deadliest and chronic diseases which causes an increase in blood sugar level. 
There are many complications, if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified.
Sometimes it is tedious in identifying if the person is having diabetes or not.
This critical problem is solved by the rise in machine learning approaches. 
The motive of this Project is to design a model which can prognosticate the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy. 
Therefore, two machine learning classification algorithms namely Decision Tree, and K- Nearest Neighbors are used in this experiment to detect diabetes at an early stage.
Experiments are performed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) which is sourced from from NIDDK. 
The performances of these two algorithms are evaluated on various measures like Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure, and Recall. 
Results obtained are verified using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in a proper and systematic manner and The Project also generalizes the selection of optimal features from dataset to improve the classification accuracy.
